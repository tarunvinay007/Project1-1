    <p> <b> Glossary </b> <br>
<p>The term factory refers to an object that is used for the creation of additional objects in object-oriented programming (OOP). Formally, a factory is a function or method that produces objects of varied prototypes or classes from a method call that is presumed to be "new." The term "factory" refers to a subroutine that returns a "new" object in a broader sense; for example, factory method and factory function refer to the same thing. This is a fundamental notion in object-oriented programming, and it serves as the foundation for a variety of related software design patterns.
 </p>      <br>

<p>Instantiation is a term used in computer science to refer to the manifestation of a previously described object. In OOP (object-oriented programming), it is possible to define a class of objects. This class contains a specific set of properties (related variables), accessories (means to access those variables), and methods that are shared by every object in it (functions). It is possible to declare an instance of that object, which will give it a unique, named identity, allowing it to be utilized throughout the program. This procedure is referred to as "instantiation."
<br></p>
<p>The term "object" refers to an abstract data type that has been constructed by a developer in object-oriented programming (OOP). A single object can have several properties and methods, and it can even contain other objects. Classes are used to define objects in the majority of computer languages. Object-oriented programming allows for a more organized approach to programming. An application developer can simply generate several comparable objects and edit existing objects within a program by designating a dataset as a custom object within the program.
In the simplest case, an object could be a user account that has been created on a website. The object may be defined as a member of the class userAccount and may contain characteristics such as first and last name, email address, password, age, and so on. <br> </p>

<p>
The term "class" refers to a pattern or blueprint for producing objects in object-oriented programming (OOP). Every property and behavior that describes or makes up an object are contained within a class. <br>
</P> <p>
In computing, a namespace is a collection of currently specified symbolic names, as well as information on the objects that each name refers to. A namespace can be thought of as a dictionary, with the keys representing the object names and the values being the objects themselves. Each key-value combination corresponds to a name and the object to which it is assigned. Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary, which is accessible through the Python command line. <br>
</p> <p>
The term constructor refers to a special sort of subroutine that is invoked to generate an object in a class-based object-oriented programming framework. It helps to prepare a new object for use by taking arguments that the constructor can use to set member variables that are needed for the new object.<br>
</p> <p>
In the world of data science, fixtures are a fancy phrase for samples of data. The use of fixture data allows you to pre-populate your testing database with predetermined data before running your tests on that data. <br>
</p> <p>
When it comes down to it, type hinting simply means that you are telling the function to only take the data type that you specify. Type Hinting can be defined as a mechanism by which we can force a function to accept a specific data type in a technical sense.<br>
</p> <p>
A typecasting operation, also known as type conversion, is a way of converting an item from one data type to another by converting its data structure. In computer programming, it is used to guarantee that variables are correctly processed by a function after they have been passed through it. Converting an integer into a string is an example of typecasting.<br>
</p> <p>
A software testing process in which individual units of source code are subjected to a variety of tests in order to assess whether or not they are fit for usage is known as unit testing. Code quality is determined by and verified by this tool. </p>
    <p>
There is also the concept of a static member variable in object-oriented programming, which is a class variable of a statically defined class, that is, a member variable of a given class that is shared across all instances (objects) of the class and is accessible as a member variable of these instances (objects). </p>
    <p>
Class Method: The @classmethod decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that is evaluated after your function has been declared. As a result of this evaluation, your function definition is cast in shadows. Class methods accept the class as an implicit first argument, similar to how instance methods receive the instance as an implicit first parameter. </p>
This pattern is used in object-oriented programming to create a graphical user interface. It is also known as the fa√ßade pattern. As a Structural Design pattern, Facade Method is used to create an easier to understand and use interface for a more complicated system. It is the face of a building or, more specifically, the exterior lying interface of a complex system, which is made up of multiple sub-systems, that is referred to as the facade. Gang of Four design patterns are not complete without it. By offering a single point of entry, it makes it simpler to access the methods of the underlying systems.
It was created using the design pattern Relationships and interactions between classes or objects are often depicted in object-oriented design patterns without stating which final application classes or objects are involved. When it comes to functional programming languages, patterns that imply mutable state may not be the best fit. <br>
</p> <p>
The term "method" refers to a procedure in object-oriented programming (OOP) that is associated with both a message and an object, respectively. An object is made up of data and behavior, which are combined to form an interface that specifies how the object may be used by any of its many consumers.<br>
</p> <p>
The term "property" refers to a special kind of class member in several object-oriented programming languages that is intermediate in functionality between a field (or data member) and a method in terms of functionality. The qualities or attributes of an object are referred to as their properties.
