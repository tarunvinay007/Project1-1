       <p> Encapsulation is a fundamental idea in object-oriented programming, and it is one of the most important concepts to understand (OOP). It defines the concept of wrapping data as well as the methods that operate on data as part of a single unit. The use of this method places constraints on the direct access to variables and methods, which can prevent data from being accidentally modified. In order to prevent unintentional changes, an object's variable can only be updated by the method that created the object. Private variables are the types of variables that fall into this category.</p>
    <p>
An inheritance connection between classes in which child (or derived) classes inherit all of the members of the parent (or base) class is defined as follows: For example, an application may establish a "business object foundation" class, from which all business objects will get their properties and behaviors. This base class can have members that are shared by all child classes, such as information on the entity's state. </p>
    <p>
Polymorphism is defined as "a variety of shapes." The idea that a single method can act in a variety of ways based on the type of object that invokes it is described here. When comparing two classes, the Validate method in the Customer class behaves differently than the Validate method in the Order class. </p>
    <p>
Defining classes by simplifying reality, avoiding irrelevant features, and concentrating on what is important for a particular goal is referred to as abstraction. For example, a customer's name, title, residence, marital status, pets, children, credit card information, automobiles, and other personal information may be available. However, if the program's primary function is to process orders, the application may simply be concerned with the customer's name, address, and credit card number. </p>
